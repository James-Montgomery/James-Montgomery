Hi, I'm James Montgomery! I'm a machine learning engineer (MLE) and Data Scientist (DS) with extensive 
experince in the field, primarily working on machine learning work in the financial sector. I specialize 
in applications of bayesian statistics in reinforcement learning. 

Most of the code on my Github is written for fun. I find writing code relaxing and I'm always looking 
to hone my skills. As a DS team lead, its also fun to get my hands on the keyboard and brush off the rust.

Feel free to explore my Github or check out my linked in and website:
